JSJaC v0.4
==========

* ...

JSJaC v0.3.x
============
* Initial support for http binding (in polling mode though)

* Initial support for safari (thanks to Matthew Hershberger)


JSJaC v0.2
==========

* send always does asychronous send now as http polling doesn't
  support this.

  In detail: When sending a packet where we expect a reply to it
  http polling doesn't make sure that this reply is contained
  within the http body reply to the query sent. So we have to
  setup a callback that handles the reply once it has been
  delivered to us.

* added a dedicated method syncedSend that sends in synchronous
  mode

  First read above, then understand that you can't expect any
  response to this call. It's there to make sure, sending is
  finished before windows get closed

* added events 'onconnect', 'ondisconnect' and 'onerror'. see API
  for details.

* removed method process() as polling is started at connect() now.
