JSJaC - JavaScript Jabber Client Library
========================================

JSJaC is a jabber client library written in JavaScript to ease
implementation of web based jabber clients. For communication with a
jabber server it needs to support either [1]HTTP Polling or [2]HTTP
Binding. JSJaC has an object oriented design which should be quite
easy to use. Communication is done by using the HTTPRequest
object. Your browser must support this.

Support for HTTP-Binding is not implemented at the moment as there are
no jabber servers available that support this. As soon as there is a
server side implementation of HTTP-Binding available, JSJaC will
support it too.

License
=======

JSJaC is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). This basically means that you have to license applications
based on JSJaC under the terms of the GPL too. If you want to develop
commercial application an alternative commercial license is
available. Please contact Stefan Strigler <steve@zeank.in-berlin.de>
for information.

Usage
=====

In order to use JSJaC within your web application you have to include
the following javascript files:

* sha1.js
* xmlextras.js
* JSJaCConnection.js
* JSJaCPacket.js
* JSJaCHTTPPollingConnection.js

Due to security restrictions you will have to enable mod_proxy and mod_rewrite for apache web server and add a RewriteRule for the domain which serves your web application so that request on a certain base address (which can be chosen by yourself) are redirect by use of apaches built in proxy module to the http base address of the jabber servers http polling or binding adresse. E.g.:

%<---
<VirtualHost *>
  Servername jabber.mydomain.com
  DocumentRoot /home/jabber/jwchat/htdocs
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/http-poll/ http://jabber.mydomain.com:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<---

Now start using it by:

%<-----
var oDbg = new Debugger();
var oCon = new JabberHTTPPollingConnection(oDbg);

oCon.connect("http://jabber.mydomain.com/http-poll/","jabber.mydomain.com","test","web","secret"); // login in user with name "test", resource "web" and password "secret"

if (oCon.connected())
  oDbg.log("Connected");
else {
  oDbg.log("Connection failed");
  return;
}

/* register handlers */
oCon.registerHandler("message",handleMessage);
oCon.registerHandler("presence",handlePresence);
oCon.registerHandler("iq",handleIQ);

/* send presence */
oCon.send(new JSJaCPresence());

/* start handling incoming packets */
oCon.process(2000); // poll every 2 seconds
%<----

Note: JSJaCConnection supports use of [3]Debugger which is available separately.

For a more detailed example how to use this lib please have a look at
