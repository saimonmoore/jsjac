JSJaC - JavaScript Jabber Client Library
========================================

JSJaC is a jabber client library written in JavaScript to ease
implementation of web based jabber clients. For communication with a
jabber server it needs to support either [1]HTTP Polling or [2]HTTP
Binding. JSJaC has an object oriented interface which should be quite
easy to use. Communication is done by using the HTTPRequest
object also refered to as AJAX technology. Your browser must support 
this.

Hints on Usage
==============

Service Address
---------------

Due to security restrictions you may have to forward or proxy requests
to your jabber server's service address.

Let's say your JSJaC based web application is located at
http://example.com. Your Jabber server is at jabber.example.com and
it's HTTP Binding service is located at
http://jabber.example.org:5280.

As most browser don't allow scripts to connect to a different domain
and/or port as they have been loaded from you'd have to find a way how
to access this service at some URI hosted at http://example.com/.

If you're using apache you could use mod_proxy and mod_rewrite to do
this job for you:

%<---
<VirtualHost *>
  Servername example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/ww
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^/http-bind/ http://jabber.example.com:5280/http-bind/ [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<---

With this you'd end up having access to the Jabber server's service at
http://example.com/http-bind/ (the httpbase address).

for in Intrigue
---------------

JSJaC extends the prototypes of the built-in types. This may cause
problems with for loops. Please have a look at
http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/09/26/for-in-intrigue/ for a detailed
description of what's going on here and how to fix it.

Debug Logger
------------

JSJaCConnection supports use of [3]JSDebugger which is available
separately.

JSJaC also ships with a class 'FirebugLogger' which lets you log to
Firebug's console.
