JSJaC - JavaScript Jabber Client Library
========================================

JSJaC is a jabber client library written in JavaScript to ease
implementation of web based jabber clients. For communication with a
jabber server it needs to support either [1]HTTP Polling or [2]HTTP
Binding. JSJaC has an object oriented interface which should be quite
easy to use. Communication is done by using the HTTPRequest
object also refered to as AJAX technology. Your browser must support 
this.

Hints on Usage
==============

Due to security restrictions you will have to proxy requests like
mod_proxy and mod_rewrite for apache web servers can do and add a
RewriteRule for the domain which serves your web application so that
request on a certain base address (which can be chosen by yourself)
are redirect by use of apache's built in proxy module to the http base
address of the HTTP Polling or HTTP Binding service. E.g.:

%<---
<VirtualHost *>
  Servername jabber.mydomain.com
  DocumentRoot /home/jabber/jwchat/htdocs
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^/http-poll/ http://jabber.mydomain.com:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<---

For an example on how to use this library within your web application
